- 👋 Hi, I’m @KBlacksmith
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can. I might chew more than I can bite, but I'll keep on biting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development. There are other things I want to learn, but I'll be learning them at college, so I'll try to learn on my own what I won't learn at school. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as many projects as I can, but I want to build up my skills first, I wouldn't want to be a burden on others. 
- 📫 How to reach me: the closest thing to a "professional" e-mail I have is oddjobkebin02@gmail.com, but it's honestly a 50/50 whether I'll read any mail in there.
